                <p class="text-faded">I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for innovationâ€”driven to develop programs and devices that help those in need while inspiring others to pursue their own goals.
Beyond my studies, I am a dedicated leader in my full-time job and a proud mother of two. Balancing work, school, and family has taught me the value of time management, resilience, and learning through experience.
Above all, being a role model for my boys motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I do.
